# SVInfiniteScrolling

These UIScrollView categories makes it super easy to add infinite scrolling fonctionalities to any UIScrollView (or any of its subclass). Instead of relying on delegates and/or subclassing `UIViewController`, SVInfiniteScrolling uses the Objective-C runtime to add the following method to `UIScrollView`:

```objective-c
- (void)addInfiniteScrollingWithActionHandler:(void (^)(void))actionHandler;
```

## Installation

### From CocoaPods

Add `pod 'SVInfiniteScrolling', :git => 'https://github.com/liruqi/SVInfiniteScrolling'` to your Podfile.

### Manually

_**Important note if your project doesn't use ARC**: you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to  `UIScrollView+SVInfiniteScrolling.m` in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources._

* Drag the `SVPullToRefresh/SVPullToRefresh` folder into your project.
* Add the **QuartzCore** framework to your project.
* Import `UIScrollView+SVInfiniteScrolling.h`

## Usage

(see sample Xcode project in `/Demo`)

### Adding Infinite Scrolling

```objective-c
[tableView addInfiniteScrollingWithActionHandler:^{
    // append data to data source, insert new cells at the end of table view
    // call [tableView.infiniteScrollingView stopAnimating] when done
}];
```

If youâ€™d like to programmatically trigger the loading (for instance in `viewDidAppear:`), you can do so with:

```objective-c
[tableView triggerInfiniteScrolling];
```

You can temporarily hide the infinite scrolling view by setting the `showsInfiniteScrolling` property:

```objective-c
tableView.showsInfiniteScrolling = NO;
```

#### Customization

The infinite scrolling view can be customized using the following methods:

```objective-c
- (void)setActivityIndicatorViewStyle:(UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle)activityIndicatorViewStyle;
- (void)setCustomView:(UIView *)view forState:(SVInfiniteScrollingState)state;
```

You can access these properties through your scroll view's `infiniteScrollingView` property. 

## Under the hood

SVInfiniteScrolling extends `UIScrollView` by adding new public methods as well as a dynamic properties. 

It uses key-value observing to track the scrollView's `contentOffset`.
